Labelling criteria


Strabismus detected:
Misalignment of the pupillary reflexes in any direction, when subject is looking straight ahead 

Strabismus not detected:
Pupillary reflexes aligned when subject is looking straight ahead
Both pupils must be aligned and facing the camera
Light reflection on cornea must be in the center of both pupils

Red eye detected:
Any redness on the white part of the right eye surrounding the iris
Any redness on the white part of the left eye surrounding the iris

Red eye not detected:
No redness in white part of the right eye surrounding the iris
No redness in white part of the left eye surrounding the iris

Ptosis detected:
Drooping of the upper eye lid of the right eye
Drooping of the upper eye lid of the left eye

Ptosis not detected:
No drooping of the upper eye lid of the right eye
No drooping of the upper eye lid of the left eye

Pterygium detected:
Abnormal triangular mass of light coloured tissue extending across the cornea horizontally from the white of the right eye
Abnormal triangular mass of light coloured tissue extending across the cornea horizontally from the white of the left eye

Pterygium not detected:
Absence of abnormal triangular mass of light coloured tissue extending across the cornea horizontally from the white of the right eye
Absence of abnormal triangular mass of light coloured tissue extending across the cornea horizontally from the white of the left eye


Anotating Instructions
Semantic Segmentation - We need to definitively know whether or not an image contains the diseases in question. The goal is to understand what’s in the image at a pixel level. 
Image Classification - Bounding boxes are used to detect objects. 
Upload raw images into system 
Image annotation tool - Vector pen allows drawing freehand and generating straight lines
Draw regions on image 
Label clearly and correctly what the disease is
Label clearly and correctly when there is no evidence of the disease
Save data to standardised format
Second annotator labels and reviews previous annotations
Save data to standardised format
Ready for data training

Data Quality Checks
Consistency
Accuracy of labelled data 
Labelled twice with majority voting
Meticulous training of annotators 
Gold standard, consensus, review 
We will have a benchmark which is a designated labelled asset as a ‘gold standard’ and compare other annotations to that asset.
Canary Deployment 
We will deploy smaller batches of labelled images and work iteratively before labelling the total dataset. 

Collaboration and performance monitoring
We have an organized system to invite and supervise all labelers during an image annotation project. 
We will monitor data efficiency via 1) Throughput 2) Efficiency 3) Quality
